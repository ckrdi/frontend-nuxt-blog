      <h2>Hello there, my name's Agung.</h2>
      <p>I've been learning web development for over a year.</p>
      <p>
        I used to work at a financial service company as an Appraiser/Credit
        Analyst. <br />
        In 2020, I decided to quit my stable job in order to pursue web
        development career.
      </p>
      <p>
        Languages I code are HTML, CSS, Sass, Javascript, and Vue. <br />
        Currently, I am honing my front-end skills and open to new
        opportunities.
